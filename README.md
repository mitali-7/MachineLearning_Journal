# MachineLearning_Journal

A repository containing my hands on ML & DL implementations, notes, and mini projects built while learning core concepts.

It includes Python notebooks for fundamentals, data analysis, feature engineering, and initial ML models, along with small Flask and Streamlit demo apps.

Note: This repo is actively updated as I progress through new ML/DL topics and algorithms.
